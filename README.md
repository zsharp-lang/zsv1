# Z# Language


Welcome to the Z# language repository! This repository holds the first released version of Z#.

Z# is a typesafe, interpreterd language. It is still very much a WIP so don't expect it to work smoothly.

This repository is undergoing massive rewrites and the architecture is still under development.
Due to that, contributions are currently not accepted.

However, suggestions about everything (syntax, concepts, architecture, etc..) are always welcome.
